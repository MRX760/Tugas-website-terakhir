<p>		 I've made it after i watched a tutorial video in youtube.. and yes, i've done it. Coding is little bit hard because it must be your first time. When you completed some task or exercise from your tutor, or book.. it will be kinda easier. You need a lot of practice to improve your skill. To be a Professional web designer or anything you wanna be. </p>
<p>		I'm very excited about coding. I love science and technology, also astronomy. Whenever i look at the sky, i imagine if i can fly with my technology i've made by my own hand.
